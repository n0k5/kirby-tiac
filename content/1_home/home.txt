    # A case for generalism
    
    Absolutely. To be honest, I don’t really want to specify. I don’t want to focus just yet. I want to have fun and try my hand at creating as much for as much, as much as I possibly can (clearly, copywriting is not a strong suit). I don’t think this translates to being bad at a lot of things. It doesn’t mean I’m necessarily good at a lot of things, either. I’ve failed, a lot. I’ve made mistakes. I continue to do so to this day. As the cliche goes, I learn from them and keep moving forward. Always progressing.
