        ### 01
        ## Problem
        
        Those untangible, unseen and unpredictable moments between people are what makes the difference between an unforgettable experience and customers forgetting Ultimate Break.

        ## Challenges
        
        There’s a real need to instill confidence in not only the product itself, but in the customer too. EFUB enables individuals to grow personally through life experience, which is a big responsibility.

        ### 03
        ## Thinking
        
        FUN. It’s a word that in branding, we are told to avoid. But there was no way of getting around the pure fun aspect of EFUB. It has to communicate joy, laughter, enjoyment, excitement and play.

        ### 04
        ## Solution
        
        Through photography, copywriting and EF’s heritage, authencitiy is a buzz word that is still relevant to the EFUB customer base. It has to appear accesible through it’s realness.
